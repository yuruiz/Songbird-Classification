The classifiers we used are

\textbf{Nearest Neighbor (NN).} We used euclidean and $\chi^2$ distance.

\textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM).} This is the most common approach for multi-label classification. We tried linear SVM, sigmoid SVM and SVM with polynomial and rbf kernel.

%textbf{Support Vector Regression (SVR).} We use SVR to produce a soft output version of SVM

\textbf{Random Forest.} 
Random Forest is operated by constructing decision tree structure by the training examples. \
