It is important to gain a better understanding about the climate and ecological changes in the world. One way to address this is to study seasonal migration patterns in songbird populations, since birds respond quickly to environmental changes
During migratory periods, many species of songbirds use flight calls, which are species-specific and are distinct from other vocalizations. Therefore, flight calls information can be used to determine the relative abundance of species and is important to understand long-term population trends. Due to costly human effort to collect data about birds in traditional methods, using machine learing (ML) methods to identify bird species from continuous audio recordings has been a hot topic in in recent conference competitions. Although there are some recent advances  it is still an open ML problem to reliably identify bird sounds in field recordings data due to simultaneously vocalizing birds and various background noise.
