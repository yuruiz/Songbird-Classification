Version 3.0 release of the fast additive kernel classifiers

Contains: 

libsvm-mat-3.0-1 : latest version of libsvm at the time of release. 

Updates: 
1. Support for learning models using the intersection, chisquared, and JS kernels
2. Fast approximate classification for these kernels using piecewise linear approximations. 
3. ONLY piecewise linear approximations are supported. The binary search based exact classification 
   for intersection kernel is no longer supported. 
4. mex code for picewise linear interpolation, weighted kernel sampling and a fast binary search based 
   version for the intersection kernel. 
   
Usage : 
Run the demo.m : It trains a libsvm model for the three kernels and compares the predictions using the
exact classifier of LIBSVM and the picewise linear approximations using 100 uniform samples for each dimension. 


matlab functions: 

compute_approximate_classifier : computes the approximate classifier

svmpredict_approx : performs predictions using piecewise linear approximation.
