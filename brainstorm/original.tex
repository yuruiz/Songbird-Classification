\section{General}

Some primary thoughts about how to proceed:

(1) For setting a periodic meeting: Maybe we can schedule a meeting (weekly or every 10 days, each with 15min~60min) for resolving any potential issues. Seems some time slots in Friday might be good. 

(2) For the software development: a possible way is somewhat to take an agile form to iterative and incremental development. Since our work process is most in sequential, we need define all intermediate interfaces and produce some sample files with sufficient size (the number of files will certainly be growing as time goes on).  With these intermediate interfaces and files, we can work independently to provide a prototype version for the midterm. Afterward, we can then refine the system as sufficient data are ready, for the final goal.
