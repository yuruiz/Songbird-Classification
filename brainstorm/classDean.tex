If the dimensions are not too high.
I'll try support vector mahcine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR).
Probably with linear kernel if the features are not histograms.
In this case, the output of SVM will be discrete class labels (1, 2, ... C),
and the output of SVR will be a vector of length C. Each element in the
vector will be a double from 0~1.
