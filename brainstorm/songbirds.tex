\cite{BriggsMLSP13} It is important to gain a better understanding of bird behavior
and population trends. Birds respond quickly to environmental change, and may also tell us about other organisms (e.g.,
insects they feed on), while being easier to detect. Traditional
methods for collecting data about birds involves costly hu-
man effort. A promising alternative is acoustic monitoring.
There are many advantages to recording audio of birds com-
pared to human surveys, including increased temporal and
spatial resolution and extent, applicability in remote sites, re-
duced observer bias, and potentially lower cost. However, it is
an open problem for signal processing and machine learning
to reliably identify bird sounds in real-world audio data col-
lected in an acoustic monitoring scenario. Some of the major
challenges include multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds,
other sources of non-bird sound (e.g., buzzing insects), and
background noise like wind, rain, and motor vehicles.
