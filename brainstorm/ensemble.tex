\subsubsection{Existing Methods in ML}

\paragraph{Bootstrap aggregating (bagging)}
Bootstrap aggregating, often abbreviated as bagging \cite{breiman1996bagging}, involves having each model in the ensemble vote with equal weight.

\paragraph{Random forest}

Random forest \cite{breiman2001random}: operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes output by individual trees. 

\paragraph{AdaBoost}

AdaBoost \cite{freund1997decision}, short for "Adaptive Boosting", in the sense that subsequent classifiers built are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. 

\paragraph{Gradient boosting}
\label{sec:ml:GradientBoosting}
Gradient boosting \cite{friedman2001greedy} is a machine learning technique for regression problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. The gradient boosting method can also be used for classification problems by reducing them to regression with a suitable loss function.

\paragraph{Bayesian model averaging}

Bayesian model averaging (BMA) \cite{hoeting1999bayesian}  is a pratical ensemble technique that seeks to approximate the Bayes Optimal Classifier by sampling hypotheses from the hypothesis space, and combining them using Bayes' law.

\subsubsection{Applications on Songbirds}

\paragraph{Ensemble logistic regression and gradiant bootsting classfiers \cite{Massaron13}}

After estimating the probabilities of species being present in a time unit in a
sound file (as for as logistic regression models using its link function, as for as hinge
regression models by rescaling and clipping the results), simply averaged logistic and hinge
probability results and therefore obtained a first ensemble forecast of the presence of every
singular species in every row of every target transposed test MFCC matrix.

In order to turn the results relative to single time units into overall probabilities of species
presence in each sound file, the author empirically experimented that using for each test
matrix a moving average of 200 rows and retaining for each species the maximum
probability result allowed to obtain a prediction whose public AUC was 0.87791 and its
private one was 0.87120.

Noticing, by direct inspection of the fitted results on the train set and on the test results, that
the estimations had surely an high recall of the species (systematically a large number of
species had high scores for each test MFCC matrix, pointing out the likelihood of many false
positives) but were likely lacking the necessary precision to reach higher scores on the
Kaggle’s leaderboard, the author decided to integrate the linear models by a different
approach based on gradient boosting classifiers (Section \ref{sec:ml:GradientBoosting}), as implemented in the Scikit-learn
library in Python \cite{pedregosa2011scikit} (using the function {\em GradientBoostingClassifier}).

The underlying idea was that gradient boosting classifier (GBC), allowing interactions, has
surely less bias than the linear models (thus an increased precision) but were suffering from
an higher variance in estimates.

The ensemble approach required to create a new training dataset, resampling the initial one,
in order to obtain, for each target species, all the examples of the target species itself and a
5\% of examples available in each training MFCC matrix.

By examining some randomly chosen predictions from the test set, it can be observed that, as
depicted in figure 1 for test sound file no. 500, an ensemble of logistic and hinge
regressions tends to polarize the results in high and low probability ends and to mark many
species as possibly present in the sound file.

The same graphical inspection for the GBC model reveals a completely different patter,
being the estimated probabilities limited in value, with spikes relative to only the most likely
ones. Such a pattern, repeated all over the test file, confirms the author’s expectation of the
gradient boosting approach to point out only the species certainly present with an high
probability and confidence, thus penalizing the recall of other species whose presence is
suspected, but with equivalent certainty, confirmed.

Finally, on the basis of such an insight, it has therefore been created an ensemble bringing
together the results from both the averaged linear models and the gradient boosting
classifier, by means of an harmonic mean, brought the final result of a public AUC of
0.89575 and a private one of 0.89041.

It is observed in figure 3 how the previously polarized predictions have naturally arranged
themselves into probability tiers, allowing a better probability estimation, as for as the AUC
measure.

The proposed approach highlights how an ensemble mixing high bias / low variance models
and low bias / high variance ones may prove an effective strategy in bioacoustics problems.
Moreover, the gradient boosting classifiers are a tree based machine learning methodology
that should better explored. There are
furthermore open opportunities in further tuning of models’ hyper-parameters and in
simplifying the ensemble strategy.

\paragraph{Linear blending \cite{chennovel13}}

Identify prominent features from windowing mfccs with overlap and leverage them to build an ensemble classifier which is a blend of different classifiers (Gradient Boosting Tree
models, Random Forest models and Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear model etc). 

As blending algorithm we use a simple basic blending - linear blending. A linear blender is easy to
implement. The most basic blending method is to compute the final prediction simply as the mean
over all the predictions in the ensemble. Better results can be obtained, if the final prediction is
given by a linear combination of the ensemble predictions. In this case, the combination coefficients
have to be determined by optimization procedure, in general by regularized linear regression. In our
case, All inputs (the predictions) are normalized to [0...+1]. We use linear blending approach and
the coefficients are determined by cross-validation performance on average precision. For validation
we use 10-fold cross-validation.

\subsubsection{Other Thoughts}

\paragraph{unknown class}

In practice, the rejection option selects the objects that cannot be assigned to any class with sufficient confidence.
